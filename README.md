# Type-Inference

nmlTypeInference.sml - 
Created a constraint solver for type inference by implementing function solve : con -> subst in the provided ML file nmlTypeInference.sml. Which takes as argument a constraint of type con and returns an “idempotent” substitution of type subst

Completed the incomplete type inference algorithm for nano-ML in the given nmlTypeInference.sml file. I did this through completeing the typeof function which implements the typing rules for expressions. Specifically completing the definitions of the nested functions ty and literal.


# What I Learned

* On the programming side, pulled back the curtain on type inference by implementing a constraint solver and type checker for nano-ML
* Deeper knowldge of the Hindley-Milner type system
